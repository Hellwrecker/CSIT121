<h1>GAMEPLAY</h1>

    <h2>How to play:</h2>

          <h3>Explore</h3>
      <p>You wake naked on a mysterious island armed only with a rock and a torch. You’ll need to brave natural dangers (from heat and cold to thirst and starvation), build a shelter, eat (or be eaten), scavenge materials. Explore the island, its abandoned settlements, mysterious monuments and the factions that occupy them. But, above all, watch out for other survivors...</p>
          <h3>Build</h3>
      <p>Design and build bases to defend your territory or control the resources of the island. Research the tech tree, grow farms, command electricity, commandeer vehicles from horses to cars to boats to helicopters. Whatever it takes to get ahead.</p>
          <h3>Survive</h3>
      <p>There are no rules in Rust but the ones you make for yourself. Craft tools, armor and weapons to defend yourself. Cooperate with friends and allies and build a town together. Explore the island and what’s happening in it. Trade with other players. Or prey on them, raiding their bases and taking their hard-won goods.</p>
